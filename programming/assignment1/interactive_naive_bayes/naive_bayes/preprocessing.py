# 1. Read file
# 2. Use columns: category, content
# 3. Make sure there is no missing data or empty strings (or nan)
# 4. Get all unique words
# 5. Transform content into the frequency of each word
# 6. Data would be Dict[int, Dict[str, int]]
# 7. Transform data to be np.array[int] (len=categories) and np.array[int, int]
#    (len=[categories, words])
