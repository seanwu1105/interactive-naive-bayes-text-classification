## Summary

Probability builds trust.

Extrinsic annotation is worse than intrinsic annotation.

Discrete is better than continuous for laypeople.

HOP is easier to understand but needs more time (also animation).

glanceability/false precision tradeoff.

Create quantile dotplots.

Conduct an experiment to see how well each visualization performs.

We recommend discrete outcome plots with few enough outcomes to take
advantage of subitizing.

Visual appeal vs. estimation tradeoff

## Insights

- Combine probability distribution graph with user events to calculate the risk and suggest the user to take action.
- Once we show the status as a probability distribution, we can collect some meta data (app is closed/GPS moving) to improve the probability estimation.
- Five feared that, if given uncertainty information, they would become responsible for making decisions, and would have to take responsibility for the
wrong decision: â€œyou're more likely to be unhappy than if
you missed the bus and can just blame the app. (business owner would be benefit actually)

- really good balance decision for the glaceability tradeoff
